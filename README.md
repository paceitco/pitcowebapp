# Usage Instructions

## Prerequisites
* You'll need to have `npx` installed
* You'll need to have a physical/emulated Android/iOS device to test the mobile application - for web, you can access it on any modern web browser on http://localhost:8081/

## Install Dependencies

* `npm install @react-navigation/native react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-navigation/stack react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated @react-native-async-storage/async-storage rimraf@^4.0.0 glob@^9.0.0`
* `mkdir ios`
* `npx pod-install ios`

## Start your Android emulator (if using Android)

* For example: `emulator -avd "Pixel_9_Pro_XL"`

## Execute the following command to run the application (then press "i" for iOS, "w" for Web and "a" for Android - you might have to scan the QR code generated by Expo)

* `npx expo start --clear`
